## Description

The Keylogger is a Python-based tool that captures every key press and logs it to a file. While its application is vast, it can serve developers aiming to debug applications, provide parental controls (with proper consent), or aid cybersecurity professionals in ethical testing scenarios.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the Keylogger script.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary Python libraries:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1. Start the keylogger:

```
python keylogger.py
```

2. As keys are pressed, they'll be logged to a `key_log.txt` file within the current directory.
3. To stop the keylogger, use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+C`.
