# Python Security Projects üîê

Welcome to my collection of Python security projects! This repository showcases a variety of standalone scripts, each emphasizing different aspects of cybersecurity and the applications of Python in the realm of security.

## üåü **Projects Contained**

- [FileChecker](./FileChecker): A utility for checking file hashes to verify their integrity.
- [Keylogger](./Keylogger): A simple keylogger tool.
- [NetworkScanner](./NetworkScanner): A tool that scans the local network to grab IP and MAC addresses of connected devices.
- [PortScanner](./PortScanner): A utility for scanning network ports to identify open services and potential vulnerabilities.
- [StegaImage](./StegaImage): A project focused on image steganography for embedding and extracting data within images.
- [URLExtractor](./URLExtractor): A web-crawling tool that extracts and lists URLs, with the capability for recursive crawling through linked pages.

## üõ† **Setup**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DAVEALLCAPS/python-security-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the desired project's directory:

3. Follow the setup instructions in the project's specific README.md.

## üéØ **Goal**

The purpose of curating these projects is to delve deep into the intersections of Python and cybersecurity. Through hands-on building and testing, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the security landscape and the pivotal role Python plays within it. It's a thrilling journey into the world of bits and bytes, and I invite the community to join me in this adventure!
