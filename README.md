# Python Security Projects 🔐

Welcome to my collection of Python security projects! This repository showcases a variety of standalone scripts, each emphasizing different aspects of cybersecurity and the applications of Python in the realm of security.

## 🌟 **Projects Contained**

- **Network Scanner**: A script that identifies devices on your local network using the `scapy` library.
   - [🔗 Go to project](./NetworkScanner)
    
- **Port Scanner**: A script that checks for open ports on a target server or IP address using the built-in `socket` library.
   - [🔗 Go to project](./PortScanner)

- **File Checker**: A script to check and compare checksums of a file with a number of algorithms (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512) using the built-in `hashlib` library.
   - [🔗 Go to project](./FileChecker)

- **StegaImage**: Hide your secrets in plain sight, or a PNG.
   - [🔗 Go to project](./StegaImage)
